1.  Introduction

   When maintaining consistency in distributed computing environments
   conflicting changes to system's state from concurrent operations can
   happen.  There are many different approaches to resolving such
   conflicts.  Currently popular approaches are using conflict-free
   replicated data types [CRDT] or operational transformation [OT].

   When systems and protocols support different approaches a need to
   identify those approaches arises.  This document defines how can
   those different approaches to conflict resolution can be identified
   using a standardized naming scheme.

2.  Definitions

   For the purpose of this document we define "synchronization" as the
   resolution of conflicts.  There are multiple approaches to resolving
   conflicts and we define "Merge Type" an identifier that corresponds
   to an approach of resolving conflicts.

3.  Merge Type Naming

   Naming of Merge Type follows naming requirements of media types as
   described in Section 4.2. of [RFC6838] with the following exception:
   Merge Type names consist only of a type-name without a sub-type.

   Similarly, Merge Type parameters follow Section 4.3. of [RFC6838].

   Example:

     automerge-counter
     sharedb-json; variant=1
     biggest-wins; sortby=versionid

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Merge Type Registry

   The "Merge Type Registry" defines the namespace for the
   synchronization type names and refers to their corresponding
   specifications.  The registry has been created and is now maintained
   at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/sync-types>.

4.1.1.  Procedure

   Registration of a Merge Type MUST include the following fields:

   o  Type name

   o  Required parameters

   o  Optional parameters

   o  Description

   o  Security considerations

   o  Interoperability considerations

   o  Published specification

   o  Person & email address to contact for further information

   Values to be added to this namespace require IETF Review (see
   [RFC5226], Section 4.1).

4.1.2.  Registrations

4.1.3.  Comments on Merge Type Registrations

   Comments on registered Merge Types may be submitted by members of the
   community to the IANA at iana@iana.org.  These comments will be
   reviewed by the Merge Types reviewer and then passed on to the
   "owner" of the Merge Type if possible.  Submitters of comments may
   request that their comment be attached to the Merge Type registration
   itself; if the IANA, in consultation with the Merge Types reviewer,
   approves, the comment will be made accessible in conjunction with the
   type registration.

4.1.4.  Change Procedures

   Once a Merge Type has been published by the IANA, the owner may
   request a change to its definition.  The same procedure that would be
   appropriate for the original registration request is used to process
   a change request.

   Merge Type registrations may not be deleted; Merge Types that are no
   longer believed appropriate for use can be declared OBSOLETE; such
   Merge Types will be clearly marked in the list published by the IANA.

   Significant changes to a Merge Type's definition should be requested
   only when there are serious omissions or errors in the published
   specification.  When review is required, a change request may be
   denied if it renders entities that were valid under the previous
   definition invalid under the new definition.

   The owner of a Merge Type may pass responsibility to another person
   or agency by informing the IANA; this can be done without discussion
   or review.

   The IESG may reassign responsibility for a Merge Type.  The most
   common case of this will be to enable changes to be made to types
   where the author of the registration has died, moved out of contact,
   or is otherwise unable to make changes that are important to the
   community.

5.  Security Considerations

   An analysis of security issues SHOULD be done for all registered Sync
   Types.  However, regardless of what security analysis has or has not
   been done, all descriptions of security issues MUST be as accurate as
   possible.  In particular, the security considerations MUST NOT state
   that there are "no security issues associated with this Merge Type".
   Security considerations for Merge Types MAY say that "the security
   issues associated with this Merge Type have not been assessed".

   There is absolutely no requirement that Merge Types registered be
   secure or completely free from risks.  Nevertheless, all known
   security risks MUST be identified in the registration of a Merge
   Type.

   The security considerations section of all registrations is subject
   to continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular MAY be
   extended by use of the "comments on Merge Types" mechanism described
   in Section 4.1.3 above.

   Some of the issues that need to be examined and described in a
   security analysis of a Merge Type are:

   o  Merge Types might assume particular structure of synchronized data,
      order of operations over that data, and/or presence of additional
      metadata like counters and timestamps.  Any security analysis MUST
      investigate security consequences when those assumptions are not
      satisfied.

   o  Merge Types might utilize different approaches to assure
      deterministic results.  Any security analysis MUST investigate any
      limitations of those approaches which might lead to
      non-deterministic results.

   o  Merge Types might utilize randomness.  Any security analysis MUST
      investigate any security consequences when quality of randomness
      is tampered with, randomness being predictable or even
      controllable by an attacker.

   o  Merge Types might operate in a way which, while not directly
      harmful, may result in disclosure of information that either
      facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates user's privacy in
      some way.

   o  A Merge Type might provide an opportunity for sending a small
      amount of data that, when received and evaluated, expands
      enormously to consume all of the user's resources.  All Merge
      Types SHOULD state whether or not they provide such opportunities;
      if they do, they SHOULD discuss what steps need to be taken to
      avoid such attacks.

   o  A Merge Type might be targeted for applications that require some
      sort of security assurance but don't provide the necessary
      security mechanisms themselves.  For example, a Merge Type could be
      defined for operation on sensitive medical information that in
      turn requires external confidentiality and integrity protection
      services, or which is designed for use only within a secure
      environment.  Types SHOULD always document whether or not they
      need such services in their security considerations.
