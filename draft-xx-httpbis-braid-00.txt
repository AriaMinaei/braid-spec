                    Braid: Synchronization for HTTP
                       draft-ietf-httbis-braid-00

Abstract

  Braid is a set of extensions to HTTP that transform it from a state
  *transfer* protocol into a state *synchronization* protocol.

  Braid adds to HTTP:

     (1) *Subscriptions* to GET requests
     (2) *Versioning* to resources
     (3) *Merge semantics* for PATCH requests

  These extensions enable a web resource to synchronize automatically,
  across multiple clients and servers, and guarantee consistency using a
  OT or CRDT algorithm.

1.  Introduction

  HTTP is designed to transfer static pages.  If a page changes, it is
  the client's responsibility to issue another GET request.  This made
  sense when pages were static and written by hand.  However, today's
  websites are dynamic, generated from databases, and continuously
  mutate as their state changes.  Now we need state *synchronization*,
  not just state *transfer*.

  Unfortunately, there is no standard way to synchronize.  Instead,
  programmers write non-standard code; wiring together custom protocols
  over WebSockets and long-polling XMLHTTPrequests with stacks of
  Javascript frameworks.  The task of connecting a UI with data is one
  that every dynamic website has to do, but there is no standard way to
  do it.
