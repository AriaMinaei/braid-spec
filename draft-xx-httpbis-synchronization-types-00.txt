1.  Introduction

   When maintaining consistency in distributed computing environments
   conflicting changes to system's state from concurrent operations can
   happen.  There are many different approaches to resolving such
   conflicts.  Currently popular approaches are using conflict-free
   replicated data types [CRDT] or operational transformation [OT].

   When systems and protocols support different approaches a need to
   identify those approaches arises.  This document defines how can those
   different approaches to conflict resolution can be identified using
   a standardized naming scheme.

2.  Definitions

   For the purpose of this document we define resolution of conflicts as
   synchronization.  There are different approaches to synchronize and we
   define an identifier for each such approach a synchronization type.
   Those synchronization types might have additional parameters.

5.  Security Considerations

   An analysis of security issues SHOULD be done for all registered
   synchronization types.  However, regardless of what security analysis
   has or has not been done, all descriptions of security issues MUST be
   as accurate as possible.  In particular, the security considerations
   MUST NOT state that there are "no security issues associated with
   this synchronization type".  Security considerations for
   synchronization types MAY say that "the security issues associated
   with this synchronization type have not been assessed".

   There is absolutely no requirement that synchronization types
   registered be secure or completely free from risks.  Nevertheless,
   all known security risks MUST be identified in the registration of a
   synchronization type.

   The security considerations section of all registrations is subject
   to continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular MAY be
   extended by use of the "comments on synchronization types" mechanism
   described in Section 4.1.3 above.

   Some of the issues that need to be examined and described in a
   security analysis of a synchronization type are:

   o  Synchronization types might assume particular structure of
      synchronized data, order of operations over that data, and/or
      presence of additional metadata like counters and timestamps.  Any
      security analysis MUST investigate security consequences when
      those assumptions are not satisfied.

   o  Synchronization types might utilize different approaches to
      assure deterministic results.  Any security analysis MUST
      investigate any limitations of those approaches which might lead
      to non-deterministic results.

   o  Synchronization types might utilize randomness.  Any security
      analysis MUST investigate any security consequences when quality
      of randomness is tampered with, randomness being predictable or
      even controllable by an attacker.

   o  Synchronization types might operate in a way which, while not
      directly harmful, may result in disclosure of information that
      either facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates user's
      privacy in some way.

   o  A synchronization type might provide an opportunity for sending a
      small amount of data that, when received and evaluated, expands
      enormously to consume all of the user's resources.  All
      synchronization types SHOULD state whether or not they provide
      such opportunities; if they do, they SHOULD discuss what steps
      need to be taken to avoid such attacks.

   o  A synchronization type might be targeted for applications that
      require some sort of security assurance but don't provide the
      necessary security mechanisms themselves.  For example, a
      synchronization type could be defined for operation on sensitive
      medical information that in turn requires external confidentiality
      and integrity protection services, or which is designed for use
      only within a secure environment.  Types SHOULD always document
      whether or not they need such services in their security
      considerations.
