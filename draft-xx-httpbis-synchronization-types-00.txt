1.  Introduction

   When maintaining consistency in distributed computing environments
   conflicting changes to system's state from concurrent operations can
   happen.  There are many different approaches to resolving such
   conflicts.  Currently popular approaches are using conflict-free
   replicated data types [CRDT] or operational transformation [OT].
   o  Description


   When systems and protocols support different approaches a need to
   identify those approaches arises.  This document defines how can
   those different approaches to conflict resolution can be identified
   using a standardized naming scheme.

2.  Definitions

   For the purpose of this document we define resolution of conflicts as
   synchronization.  There are different approaches to synchronize and
   we define an identifier for each such approach a synchronization
   type.  Those synchronization types might have additional parameters.

3.  Synchronization Type Naming

   Naming of synchronization type follows naming requirements of
   media types as described in Section 4.2. of [RFC6838] with the
   following exception: synchronization type names consist only of a
   type-name without a sub-type.

   Similarly, synchronization type parameters follow Section 4.3. of
   [RFC6838].

   Example:

     ot; type=json1
     crdt; history=1001

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Synchronization Type Registry

   The "Synchronization Type Registry" defines the namespace for the
   synchronization type names and refers to their corresponding
   specifications.  The registry has been created and is now maintained
   at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/synchronization-types>.

4.1.1.  Procedure

   Registration of a synchronization type MUST include the following
   fields:

   o  Type name

   o  Required parameters

   o  Optional parameters

   o  Description

   o  Security considerations

   o  Interoperability considerations

   o  Published specification

   o  Person & email address to contact for further information

   Values to be added to this namespace require IETF Review (see
   [RFC5226], Section 4.1).

4.1.2.  Registrations

4.1.3.  Comments on Synchronization Type Registrations

   Comments on registered synchronization types may be submitted by
   members of the community to the IANA at iana@iana.org.  These
   comments will be reviewed by the synchronization types reviewer and
   then passed on to the "owner" of the synchronization type if
   possible.  Submitters of comments may request that their comment be
   attached to the synchronization type registration itself; if the
   IANA, in consultation with the synchronization types reviewer,
   approves, the comment will be made accessible in conjunction with the
   type registration.

4.1.4.  Change Procedures

   Once a synchronization type has been published by the IANA, the owner
   may request a change to its definition.  The same procedure that
   would be appropriate for the original registration request is used to
   process a change request.

   Synchronization type registrations may not be deleted;
   synchronization types that are no longer believed appropriate for use
   can be declared OBSOLETE; such synchronization types will be clearly
   marked in the list published by the IANA.

   Significant changes to a synchronization type's definition should be
   requested only when there are serious omissions or errors in the
   published specification.  When review is required, a change request
   may be denied if it renders entities that were valid under the
   previous definition invalid under the new definition.

   The owner of a synchronization type may pass responsibility to
   another person or agency by informing the IANA; this can be done
   without discussion or review.

   The IESG may reassign responsibility for a synchronization type.  The
   most common case of this will be to enable changes to be made to
   types where the author of the registration has died, moved out of
   contact, or is otherwise unable to make changes that are important to
   the community.

5.  Security Considerations

   An analysis of security issues SHOULD be done for all registered
   synchronization types.  However, regardless of what security analysis
   has or has not been done, all descriptions of security issues MUST be
   as accurate as possible.  In particular, the security considerations
   MUST NOT state that there are "no security issues associated with
   this synchronization type".  Security considerations for
   synchronization types MAY say that "the security issues associated
   with this synchronization type have not been assessed".

   There is absolutely no requirement that synchronization types
   registered be secure or completely free from risks.  Nevertheless,
   all known security risks MUST be identified in the registration of a
   synchronization type.

   The security considerations section of all registrations is subject
   to continuing evaluation and modification, and in particular MAY be
   extended by use of the "comments on synchronization types" mechanism
   described in Section 4.1.3 above.

   Some of the issues that need to be examined and described in a
   security analysis of a synchronization type are:

   o  Synchronization types might assume particular structure of
      synchronized data, order of operations over that data, and/or
      presence of additional metadata like counters and timestamps.  Any
      security analysis MUST investigate security consequences when
      those assumptions are not satisfied.

   o  Synchronization types might utilize different approaches to
      assure deterministic results.  Any security analysis MUST
      investigate any limitations of those approaches which might lead
      to non-deterministic results.

   o  Synchronization types might utilize randomness.  Any security
      analysis MUST investigate any security consequences when quality
      of randomness is tampered with, randomness being predictable or
      even controllable by an attacker.

   o  Synchronization types might operate in a way which, while not
      directly harmful, may result in disclosure of information that
      either facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates user's
      privacy in some way.

   o  A synchronization type might provide an opportunity for sending a
      small amount of data that, when received and evaluated, expands
      enormously to consume all of the user's resources.  All
      synchronization types SHOULD state whether or not they provide
      such opportunities; if they do, they SHOULD discuss what steps
      need to be taken to avoid such attacks.

   o  A synchronization type might be targeted for applications that
      require some sort of security assurance but don't provide the
      necessary security mechanisms themselves.  For example, a
      synchronization type could be defined for operation on sensitive
      medical information that in turn requires external confidentiality
      and integrity protection services, or which is designed for use
      only within a secure environment.  Types SHOULD always document
      whether or not they need such services in their security
      considerations.
