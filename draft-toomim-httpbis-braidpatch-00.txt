         Braid-Patch: a General Format for Mergeable Operations
                    draft-ietf-httbis-braidpatch-00

Abstract

  These extensions enable a web resource to synchronize automatically,
  across multiple clients and servers, and guarantee consistency using a
  OT or CRDT algorithm.

1.  Introduction

  A fundamental problem in Synchronization is ensuring that two peers
  resolve the same DAG of edits consistently.  But if two edits happen
  in the same place at the same time, there occurrs what you might call
  a "conflict", and different applications will want to resolve
  conflicts differently.

  For instance, if two users edit the same text in a collaborative
  editor, the expected behavior is to all the characters that have been
  inserted, and delete all the characters that have been deleted:

                                  dogs
                                  /  \
                               cats  birds
                                  \  /
                                catbirds

  However, ...

  Implementing one of these mergeable datatypes can be difficult.
  Therefore, it saves programmers a lot of time if they can re-use a
  mergeable datatype implementation in multiple places.
